## ‚ùì Problem Statement
In a competitive market, understanding the factors driving sales performance, profitability, and customer satisfaction is crucial for sustainable growth. Our organization faces challenges in identifying top-performing products, optimizing inventory, recognizing top-performing regions, and identifying top customers. Additionally, we need to understand the financial impact of discounts to enhance our profit margins.

## üéØ Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to provide actionable insights into our sales performance, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies to boost revenue and profitability. By examining key performance indicators (KPIs) and detailed sales metrics, we aim to:

1. Identify best-selling products and high-revenue generators.
2. Assess total revenue and profit margins to gauge financial health.
3. Understand the impact of shipping methods, category, customer segments, and discounts on sales.
4. Develop targeted strategies to reduce losses and enhance customer satisfaction.
